============

Making Cryptoparties easier since 1897!

FlyRodCrosby[1] is an automated installer for Windows (stay tuned for an OSX port) for all of the standard Cryptoparty tools.  It currently handles:

GPG4Win

Tor Browser Bundle [3]

Thunderbird with Enigmail [2]

Jitsi [4]

TorBirdy [5]

We plan to support:

Bleachbit [6]

TrueCrypt [7]

Functionality to automatically download Tails [8] and burn it to a DVD

The Fake Domain Detective plugin from Access[9]


Note to potential developers
============================

When making an application available for download/install that has a detached GPG signature, remember to add the full fingerprint rather than the 8 character ID due to the security issue described in [10].
